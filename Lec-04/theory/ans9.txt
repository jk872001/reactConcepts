9.Can we use index as key in react?
Yes we can use but it is not recommended.

It is generally not recommended to use the index of an item as its key in React when rendering a list of items.

Using the index as a key can lead to unexpected behavior when the list is re-ordered or items are added or removed, because the index is not a stable identifier. When items are added or removed, the index of the remaining items changes, which can cause React to re-render the entire list instead of just updating the specific items that have changed.

It's better to use a unique identifier that is associated with each item, such as an ID from the server-side data, as the key. This ensures that React can properly track and update the items in the list, even if their order changes.

However, there is an exception to this rule, When the list is guaranteed to not change its order or size, it's safe to use indexes as keys.
In this case, when the list is small, and the number of re-renders doesn't have a significant impact on performance.

In summary, using the index as a key is not the best practice and should be avoided, if possible, use unique identifier as key for each element in list.
