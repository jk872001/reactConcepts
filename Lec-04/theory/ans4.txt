4.What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> & <></> ?
we use react.fragment to avoid an extra div in our html 

<React.Fragment></React.Fragment> is a way to group a set of React elements together without adding an extra node to the DOM. It allows you to return multiple elements from a component's render method without wrapping them in an additional element.

For example, this code will create two divs in the DOM:
<div>
  <div>First</div>
  <div>Second</div>
</div>

Instead of using a div to wrap the two inner divs, you could use a fragment to group them together and it will not add a div to the DOM.

<React.Fragment>
  <div>First</div>
  <div>Second</div>
</React.Fragment>

<></> is a shorthand for <React.Fragment> introduced in React 16.2, it's a shorthand for the same functionality.

<>
  <div>First</div>
  <div>Second</div>
</>

It's similar to the above example, but it's a shorter way of writing it.
