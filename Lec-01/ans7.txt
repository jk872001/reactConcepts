7.What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
react.development.js and react.production.js are two different versions of the React library that are optimized for different environments.

The react.development.js file is the development version of the React library, and it is intended to be used during the development of a web application. It includes helpful debugging tools and warnings that can help developers identify issues with their code.

The react.production.js file is the production version of the React library, and it is intended to be used when deploying a web application to production. It has been optimized for performance and does not include the debugging tools and warnings that are included in the development version.

You would use the react.development.js file when working on a new application or making changes to an existing application, and you would use the react.production.js file when deploying the application to production.

Both versions of the React library can be loaded via CDN by including a <script> tag in the HTML of a web page. For example:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
