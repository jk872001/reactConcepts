2.What is the importance of config.js file?
A config.js file is a JavaScript file that contains configuration settings for a specific application or project. The file usually exports an object or a set of variables that can be imported and used by other parts of the codebase. The importance of a config.js file is that it allows for easy management of settings and variables that are used throughout the application.

For example, a config.js file might contain settings for a database connection, API keys for third-party services, or application-specific constants. By keeping these settings in a single file, it allows for easy modification of these settings, without having to search through the entire codebase to find where they are used.

In addition to that, it allows for easy switching between different environments (development, staging, production) by only changing the config file.
It also allows for separating sensitive information such as secret keys or passwords from the rest of the codebase, which can help to improve security.

In summary, a config.js file is important because it allows for easy management of settings and variables, and it promotes organization, maintainability, and security in an application.
